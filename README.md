Smart Teleconferencing Camera

ABSTRACT
========

The idea of this project is to create a camera that can listen to determine the location of the speaker in the room and automatically direct itself to point at that speaker, using a binaural (two-ears) sound localization algorithm similar to what we humans use. Once the general location of the speaker has been determined, a vision module then takes over to search for the speakerâs face and center it in the frame of the camera image. Once the speaker stops talking and another speaker takes over, the camera will automatically detect this and move to point at the new speaker. In this way, the camera will mimic the action of a human observer watching a conversation among several people. This type of camera would clearly have applications in teleconferencing.

DELIVERABLES
============

* Survey of algorithms for binaural sound localization and face localization in video streams.
* Construction of camera servoing platform to control pan and tilt angles of the camera.
* Implementation of sound localization and face localization algorithms in a PC, DSP or FPGA.
* Implementation of algorithm to control camera based on sound and face localization system outputs.
* Working camera platform. Quantitative evaluation of the system performance.

PRE-REQUISITE / REQUIREMENT
===========================

Students in the project should have a excellent background in signal processing and good hands on skills with hardware design (both electrical and mechanical). A strong interest in biological systems is a plus.
